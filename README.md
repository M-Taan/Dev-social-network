# DevLeb

A social network for developers using MERN stack

The project uses Redux for state management.

A Project inspired by Brad from Traversy Media and done by me during my journey to learn the MERN stack

Setup after cloning:

```
npm install
```

After that, you need to add a mongoURI for your respective mongoDB, jwtSecret(random), and also a githubClientID/githubClientSecret to leverage the Github API. (config/default.json)

The project uses JWT for authorization. This allows for protected routes to be created.
